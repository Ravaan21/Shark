This project is built of of dire necessity, the Pedophile related content is a global epidemic, after several research, this project scans through the public IP's and looks for keywords related to pedophile content, simply if found then it will dump the IP into the list and after that a Reverse IP lookup will be performed which will reveal the location of the originating IP. 

The reporting part is yet to be developed in a manner to properly be relevant to the Aim: ie: catch pedophiles.
The source code and other details are not made public for various reasons and might change in the future. 
Rest of the equation lies into the hands of autorities, this the data collection phase is not safe to run as it will make your IP be included in the list and thus im not making this public.
